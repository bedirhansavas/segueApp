# segueApp
This project is a segueApp which integrates screens. 

First of all, I have added second viewController to my project. Later I have linked them.

After adding new button, I have directed the user to second screen without codes. This is an easy method. Since there is no need any process, when the user
click "Go to 2nd Page" button user is directed automatically. This highlighted arrow(you can see below) represent "Go to 2nd Page". Actually this method can 
be a little bit useless. Because you can not transport datas to second screen.

For us, the more important arrow is another one. Because this arrow can transport datas. For better view and more functionality I have used navigation Controller.
This process is done by clicking first screen and View Controller, Editor, Embed In and Navigation Controller respectively. (You can see the process below)

After essential codes I have transferred the data by using next Button.
